			<p> Dearest Bash, <br><br> 
			As soon as I saw you, I knew you'd be trouble. There you were, sitting with that eager look of yours. You didnt do much, but I immediately fell into a deep and uncomfortable trance. <br><br>
			The truth is, bash, I didnt like you at first. You look weird and can be confusing at times. But, I just cant get enough of you. You make it way too easy to create a new folder by simply entering <b><i>mkdir</i></b>. You always take me where I want to go when I enter <b><i>cd [folder]</i></b>. When you list everything within the folder with <b><i>ls-l</i></b>, I nearly lose my breath. Because of you, I'm never lost when I can just type <b><i>pwd</i></b>, showing exactly where I am. <br><br>One of your best attributes is that you do a lot of work for me. Like when I hit the <b><i>tab</i></b> key and you auto-complete files and various folder names, so I dont have to. I can always tell your listining by entering <b><i>echo</i></b> and you repeat exactly what I say. <br><br> Although you have a face that only a mother could love, I'd happily be your mother. <br><br> Love, <br><br> Brady
